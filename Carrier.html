        <p>
            DMD is a genetic disease. It is caused by spontaneously in the child or inherited from their mother. <br>
            Human body is made up with cells, cells include all instructions our body needs they develop, live and reproduce. They are made up of DNA.DNA are made up of smaller section called genes. <br>
            Our long strands of DNA which contain Genes are organised into chromosomes, and these are hereditary that means they are passed down from parents to children.But genes can also be spontaneously change inside an embryo during pregnancy. <br>
            In 1/3 of DMD cases, this happend spontaneously at the beginning of pregnancy. <br>
            In 2/3rd of DMD casess, the genetic changes is passed down from mother to the child. <br>
            These womens are called carriers bexause they carry the DMD gene but they do not have the conditions themselves.Some carriers have symptoms of DMD. <br>
            Evert person has 2 sets of chromosomes, which contains genes, which determined of they are male or female. females have X and males have one X and one Y chromosomes. The dystrophin gene is located in the X chromosome. <br>
            Here is a pictorial X linked dominant inheritance it is explained, so if a woman is pregnant there is a one in four chance that the baby will be effected. <br>
            If a man with DMD has children with a woman who is not a  carrier, none of sons will have DMD but all their daughters will be carrier. <br>
            Why has this happened? <br>
            NO ONE IS TO BLAME, NO ONE DID ANYTHING. <br>
            THERE IS NOTHING A MOTHER COULD DO DURING HER PREGNANCY TO PREVENT THE CHILD FROM DEVELOPING DMD. <br>
            GENES ARE COMPLICATED SOMETIMES THEY FO WRONG. <br>
            <strong>Care for Carriers</strong> <br>
            Though they are not effected, but few changes can be observed in their cardiac fuction, fatigue and muscle weakness. <br>
            accepting that this was NOT something you chose to pass onto your child, that you had NO control over which genes were passed on, and connecting with other carriers who can relate to how you're feeling and reassure you that you are not alone.

            <ul class="objective">
              <li>Try not to look into the future; instead, try to enjoy every day and the little things that make a day good.</li>
              
              <li>Treat him the same way you treat other (physically healthy) children. Boys with Duchenne mention this as one of their biggest wishes.</li> 
              
              <li>Try to let him do the same as other children as much as possible. Let him play outside, just like other children. To avoid muscle damage it is important to use lighter materials and tools.</li> 
              
              <li>Stimulate him to undertake and keep up relationships with friends. This is vital for his well-being.</li> 
              
              <li>Spread awareness of educating the child and using a wheelchair, which would benefit their child for socializing.</li>
              
              <li>For as long as possible, let him do as much as he can by himself. It will give him a feeling of independence and self-esteem.</li>
              <li>Look for a nice hobby together. </li>
              <li>Do enjoyable activities such as day trips. Do not stop doing activities because of Duchenne. If a certain activity doesn’t work any more, try to find creative solutions.</li>
