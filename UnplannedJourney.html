            The discovery of a child with a disability has profound effect on the family.  Today I  want to shed some insights of my journey through my own experience of having a child, rather children with a disability. <br>
            This is for all the people who have not shared the unique experience to understand it ,either to feel how it is like... <br>
            It is a story of two people madly in love , wants to start a family , or like planning a vacation trip to MUMBAI as soon as they settle down together.  <br>
            The couple dreamed of visiting Mumbai,made wonderful plans like strolling down on the Marine drive,visiting The Taj, watching the sun set, even imagining randomly bumping into celebrity one or two. The woman thought they may even learn some phrases of tapori language. It was so exciting for both of them. <br>
            With so much anticipation for 9 months , the day arrived for delivery or boarding the plane . They pack their bags and here they go to MUMBAI..... <br>
            After several hours,the Air - hostess comes and declares  " Welcome to Chennai " <br>
            Chennai, !!!!   What do you say ? But we boarded the plane to go to Mumbai, we are supposed to go to Mumbai. All our life , "We dreamed of going to Mumbai " <br>
            Oh, O but there is a slight change in the flight plan.They have landed us in Chennai instead of Mumbai. And here we are to stay for the rest of our lives. <br>
            The amazing part is they didn't take you to any bad or disgusting place . It is just a different place.Now, it's time to buy new books, learn a new language and adjust to a new life. Here we meet a whole new group of people, we have never met before in our life. <br>
            It's a different and a beautiful place. It is much slow-paced than Mumbai, less flashy compared to Mumbai. And after sometime here, we fell in love with the place. <br>
            Mumbai can have Amitabh Bacchan but here you have Rajnikanth, Chennai have dosa, so what if Mumbai have Pav Bhaji. <br>
            But still everybody we know is coming and going from Mumbai and they are all bragging what a wonderful time they have in Mumbai . And still of course, for the rest of our lives we will always think this is the place where we were supposed to go. That's what we planned or dreamed.  <br>
            This pain is never ever going to go away. The end of a dream is a big loss.But then we realized if we keep mourning of not landing in Mumbai,  we will never enjoy this very special , different and lovely CHENNAI.
