        <li>Reassure him. You can do this by telling him, for example: “You will get anything you need, and we know smart doctors who will do everything they can to help us”.</li>
        <li>Be sure that the boy understands that his disease is not his fault: he is not to blame!</li> 
        <li>Anger, grief and other emotions can emerge during such talks (see box 21). This is completely normal, so do not try to avoid it. Instead show understanding and be a coach of the boy’s emotions.</li>  
        <li>Do not talk about his future if he does not ask about it. If he does ask, do not avoid the subject and always be honest. But never shut the door on new possibilities by saying, for example: “There are many doctors experimenting and searching for a cure, who knows what will be possible in a few years?”</li>

    <center><h2>My forays into the wonders of everyday kitchen ingredients</h2></center> <br>
    <p>
        The importance of taking precautions against cold or chest congestion was the initial take away for me as I read about muscular dystrophy, a thought that remained etched in my mind,  as I struggled to grapple with what the condition entailed. It was challenging not only to get information about this unheard of medical condition (for me), but also learn to deal with it and anticipate how the progression would happen. <br>

As winter would approach or seasonal changes happened I began to explore the traditionally tried and tested gems of wisdom of grandma’s about one’s well being and health As access to internet was limited then, I would read and also try to find out from elders or friends the different types of remedies for simple basic things such as common cold, cough,indigestion etc.  Thus began my journey of experimenting with different ingredients found commonly in one’s own kitchen and seeing what works best for my child’s needs. These were more as a precaution or at times to relieve the symptoms in addition to doctor’s advice and medication prescribed as required.

    </p>
    <p>
      a) In infancy when my son had stuffy or blocked nose, I would slightly dry roast ajwain (carom seeds)  on a tava or pan for about 30 second or more and transfer it into a clean cloth or handkerchief  and tie up the cloth as a bundle (potli). I would place the bundle near his nostrils for about five seconds or more alternating between both the  nostrils. The strong aroma would act almost like an inhaler and offer some relief to him. <br>
        b) I also used betel leaves for relief from cold in the infancy stage. I would take one leaf and apply  oil on both sides. Heat it slowly on the gas stove on both sides for a couple of seconds  then when it is a little warm (please check the temperature ) I put it over the crown chakra and as soon as it is dry remove the leaf. <br>
        I also used betel leaves for relief from cold in the infancy stage. I would take one leaf and apply  oil on both sides. Heat it slowly on the gas stove on both sides for a couple of seconds  then when it is a little warm (please check the temperature ) I put it over the crown chakra and as soon as it is dry remove the leaf. <br>
        c) When he was a toddler, I would steam the room using a humidifier which I would place near my son’s bed . Please ensure to keep the humidifier at a safe distance from the child's bed. I would add a couple of drops  of eucalyptus oil in the humidifier. <br>
          (However,  one fallout is that the bedsheets would get stained due to the oily steam  and it would leave a strong smell on the bed sheets!). <br>
        d) Once he was a little older when he had cold, I would rub camphor oil( karpooradi thailam) on his chest and throat a little (which I used to get from Kottakal  Ayurvedic center at Delhi) and make him do steam inhalation
        After inhalation I would cover his chest and throat for  a little longer to avoid draught. <br>
        e) Now that he is a young adult, I give him kada if he has a dry cough. I boil water with grated ginger( just about an inch of ginger) and add 2-3 little coarsely crushed pepper ( Kali mirch) depending on the quantity of water used. I boil the water  till the water quantity becomes almost half. After every  two hours I give this water( after straining it) with a little honey. It is soothing for the throat and gives relief from dry cough. <br>
        f) If he has gas or a bloating sensation I take a pinch of hing (asafoetida) in a teaspoon and add three to four drops of water and mix it and apply it around the navel. Once in a while I also give saunf(fennel seeds) to chew after food for better digestion. <br>
        g) If he is worked up or anxious I give Chamomile tea with little honey. It is refreshing and has a calming effect.  <br>                       
        <br>
        There are a few preventive steps too I take, such as  <br>
i) giving warm water only to drink till date. Ensure the child is well hydrated. <br>
ii) avoid anything cold such as ice cream, cold juices,or anything just taken  
   from the refrigerator. <br>
iii) avoid aerated fizzy drinks like pepsi, coke ,fanta ,miranda etc. <br>
iv)I give soups, rasam , kadi , curry leaves powder ( a popular dish in Andhra Pradesh 
   made with coriander, pepper etc) mixed with hot rice and ghee, especially in winters. <br>        
   In the present times with widespread access to the internet and help of google one can find numerous home remedies for each and every condition. The benefits of the various common ingredients found in our kitchen are indeed amazing!  But one has to exercise caution and try based on the climate of the place, a child’s requirement, age, medications and  what is best suited for each individual. It is also advisable to consult and seek advice before just following them blindly.
